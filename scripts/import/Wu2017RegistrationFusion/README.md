## Stand-alone Usage

To use volume-to-fsaverage mappings without the trouble of downloading our entire repository, just download the `standalone_scripts_for_MNI_fsaverage_projection.zip` file for MNI152-to-fsaverage projections or the `standalone_scripts_for_Colin_fsaverage_projection.zip` file for Colin27-to-fsaverage projections; then follow the README.md inside.

Note that FreeSurfer and Matlab need to be installed before the stand-alone scripts can be run.

## Folder Contents

This directory contains the following folders and files:

- `final_warps_FS5.3`: final mappings for RF approaches (RF-M3Z and RF-ANTs) using FreeSurfer 5.3

- `liberal_cortex_masks_FS5.3`: liberal cortical masks used in surface-to-volume projections

- `scripts_final_proj`: scripts to directly use final mappings for RF approaches (RF-M3Z and RF-ANTs). Refer to README.md in this folder for how to use these scripts.

- `standalone_scripts_for_MNI_fsaverage_projection` and `standalone_scripts_for_MNI_fsaverage_projection.zip`: stand-alone scripts for using the final MNI152-to-fsaverage mapping without downloading the other folders in the CBIG repository. Refer to README.md in this folder further for how to use these scripts.

- `standalone_scripts_for_Colin_fsaverage_projection` and `standalone_scripts_for_Colin_fsaverage_projection.zip`: stand-alone scripts for using the final Colin27-to-fsaverage mapping without downloading the other folders in the CBIG repository. Refer to README.md in this folder further for how to use these scripts.

- `GSP_subjectid.csv`: list of subject IDs for GSP subjects, used by RF approaches (RF-M3Z and RF-ANTs) by default

- `colin27.register.dat`: linear registration warp between Colin27 template and fsaverage volume (used by Affine approach). This is generated using FSL, similar to FreeSurfer's own mni152.register.dat.

- `images`: image files used in some READMEs
